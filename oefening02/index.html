    <h2>What is CSGO</h2>
    <p>The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes.</p>
    <p>The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured.</p>
